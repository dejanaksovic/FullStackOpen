# Communication client-server when creating new note in single page application

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant client
    participant server
    Note over client: New note is added to some kind <br/> of local state (notes[] in spa.js file)
    client->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    server-->>client: {"message":"note created"}
    deactivate server
    Note over client: callback is triggered<br/>rerendering notes with "redrawNotes()"   
```

In this case communication is mainly to update server notes status, doesn't have to do anything with updating notes on the client side
